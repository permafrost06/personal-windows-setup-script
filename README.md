# personal-windows-setup-script
I use this script to automatically install some essential software and make some changes on a fresh install of windows.
Note: This script quietly installs microsoft visual c++ and directx but files for these are not included in this repository.

## Effects:
1. Change clock to 24h format
1. Set first day of the week to saturday
1. Add dvorak keyboard layout, set as default, change layout switch hotkey to ```ctrl+shift```
1. Remove recycle bin from desktop
1. Disable mouse acceleration
1. Show file extensions
1. File explorer/```win+e``` opens _This PC_ instead of _Quick Access_
1. Don't send files to recycle bin and delete permanently; display confirmation dialog
1. Make taskbar icons small, show label, delete default icons, hide cortana and task view button
1. Set up file and context menu associations for existing (portable) apps: 7-zip, Everything search, AutoHotkey, Rainmeter
1. Add ahk script(s) to startup.
